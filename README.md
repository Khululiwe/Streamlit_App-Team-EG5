# Streamlit-based News Classification App-Team-EG5

## Overview

As Insights Lab Consulting, we have been engaged by Newstoday, an editorial company, to develop an automated news categorization system that can improve the efficiency and accuracy of content management. This project uses advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to automate the tagging and categorization of news articles. The end-to-end solution consists of gathering and preprocessing data, developing and assessing the model, and deploying it as a user-friendly web application with Streamlit. The system will enhance operational efficiency for the editorial team and improve content discovery for readers.
